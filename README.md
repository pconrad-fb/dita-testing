# dita-testing
 
This is a very small repository I created for testing `dita-ot` with both DITA and Markdown files. I wanted to see how `dita-ot` handled both. The experiment was successful! I got output, and it was impossible to tell which content came from DITA and which from Markdown. 

I was also playing with Jenkins a little, although I suspect I wasn't using it quite right.

However, all in all, I was able to use Jenkins to create a build process that would run `dita-ot` on a schedule to build content. This is the foundation of a simple DocOps flow.
